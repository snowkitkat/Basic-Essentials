# Basic Essentials: by snowkitkat

## What is Basic Essentials?

Basic Essentials is a Skript for Minecraft that is mainly for servers running Skript. This adds features such as `/fly`, `/creative`, `/survival`, and many more to come!

## Why use Basic Essentials when I can just get Essentials?

There are multiple reasons for this. For starters, Basic Essentials is easy to customize to your liking, and to fit your server's theme. This makes it easier so that all your files for configuring are in one place. With this, you no longer have to download a seperate language file for customizing the messages, because it is all in the Skript?

## I found a bug and want to report it, but I don't know where to!

We have a [discord server](https://discord.gg/NrJd9txjsM) for Basic Essentials where you can report bugs, and suggest features!

# Instructions to Download

If you don't have it already, you can download skript [here.](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/releases)
If you already have Skript, then move BasicEssentials.sk to `plugins/Skript/scripts/` then do `/sk reload BasicEssentials` and your done!

I highly suggest using Notepad++ for editing! Make sure you have the Skript language installed!
